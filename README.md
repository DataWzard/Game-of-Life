# Game-of-Life
This program is a cellular automaton simulator based on Conway’s Game of Life.

This program simulates Conway’s Game of Life across hundreds of random starting conditions. Each run evolves for a set number of generations, and we capture both the visual outcomes (in tiled SVGs) and the numerical stats (in CSVs).
The SVGs let us quickly compare many runs side by side, spotting which ones die off, stabilize, or grow. The CSV gives us structured data so we can measure things like survival ratios or growth trends.
Together, the outputs are useful for learning about emergence, doing quantitative experiments, and even creating generative art. It’s a sandbox where simple rules lead to complex, surprising results.
